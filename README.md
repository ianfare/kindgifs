A little script to make cute pixelly gifs of text and tiny flowers, to say nice things to people

Use: run kindgifs.py (python3 kindgifs.py), and type in the text you want to make a gif out of! (or pass it as command line argument(s))

Uses the font of the lovely [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)

You can also download a Windows executable on [itch.io](https://piconaut.itch.io/kindgifs)

Ironically although I made this using Linux, I can't get freeze.py to give me a proper binary. So if anyone can help me out with freeze.py, that would be amazing.
